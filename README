* Simple Nix, Haskell & Ghcide example

This project uses Niv (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/niv) for
managing the Nix depdendencies. The Nixpkgs and Niv snapshots used can
be updated using `niv update` command in the Nix shell.

For the sake of having a non-trivial example this project uses Gtk
from Haskell to demonstrate the usage of things that depend on
non-Haskell stuff.

** Usage:

0. `nix-shell` downloads dependencies, GHC and ghcide IDE backend
   which can be used from editor that has been configured to use ghcide.
1. `cabal new-build` compiles the project
2. `cabal new-run` runs the program, opens a window with "Hello world" button.
